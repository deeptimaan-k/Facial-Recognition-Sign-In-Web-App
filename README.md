## 🌐 Technology Stack

This project combines **cutting-edge web technologies** and **machine learning** for a highly interactive, secure, and smooth employee sign-in experience.

### Front-End:
- **Three.js**: Create stunning 3D visuals and interactive scenes.
- **WebGL**: Render real-time 3D graphics in the browser.
- **WebRTC**: Access the camera for capturing employee images.
- **GSAP** or **Anime.js**: Power smooth, fluid animations and transitions.
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Build a responsive and dynamic user interface.

### Back-End:
- **Node.js + Express**: Handle API requests, image processing, and communication between the front-end and the facial recognition model.
- **Face Recognition**:
  - **FaceNet/DeepFace**: Extract facial embeddings for identity verification.
  - **face-api.js**: For client-side face detection (optional).
  
### Database:
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**: Store employee information, facial embeddings, and attendance logs securely.

## 🌈 Key Features Breakdown

### 🎥 Facial Recognition Sign-In
- Employees approach the camera, and the app captures their image.
- The captured face is processed using advanced **face recognition algorithms**.
- If a match is found in the **MongoDB** database, the employee is **successfully signed in**, and their attendance is logged.

### 🌐 3D Interactive User Interface
- Every interaction with the app is enhanced with **3D animations**. Buttons feel real, transitions are seamless, and users are immersed in the experience.
- Visual feedback, such as **success/failure animations** (spinning checkmarks, shaking error screens), makes the login process exciting and intuitive.

### 📊 Admin Dashboard
- The admin dashboard allows for full control of employee management:
  - Add new employees with facial data.
  - Monitor employee sign-ins and attendance records.
  - Generate attendance reports with **real-time data**.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-facial-recognition-signin.git
cd 3d-facial-recognition-signin
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
For the **back-end** (Node.js/Express):
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

For the **front-end** (if using a framework like React):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory with the following values:
```bash
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
PORT=5000
FACE_RECOGNITION_MODEL=<path-to-your-facenet-model>
```

### 4. Run the Application:
Start the **back-end server**:
```bash
npm start
```

Start the **front-end** (React/Vue):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Access the App:
Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the 3D Sign-In Interface.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### 1. Enroll a New Employee:
- Visit `/admin` and add a new employee.
- Capture their face using the camera, and store their face embedding in MongoDB.

### 2. Employee Sign-In:
- Employees approach the camera on the sign-in page.
- The system captures the face, processes the image, and signs them in if their face matches a record in the database.

### 3. Admin Dashboard:
- Log into the admin dashboard to view real-time attendance logs, update employee records, and manage sign-ins.

---

## ⚡ Future Enhancements
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Add another layer of security by combining facial recognition with other authentication methods.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Develop a mobile version using **React Native** or **Flutter** to allow employees to sign in via their mobile devices.
- **AI-based Analytics**: Provide attendance analytics, such as trends, late arrivals, and absenteeism analysis.
